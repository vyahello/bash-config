# Shell config
My useful shell (`bashrc`, `zshrc` and `vimrc`) configuration files/scripts for system. Enjoy it!

# Usage

## Setup

Please put shell configs into the root of your home directory e.g:
```shell script
mv <dot-config> ~/
```

Please put shell scripts into `/usr/local/bin` directory:
```shell script
mv text_to_log /usr/local/bin
```

## Contributing
- clone the repository
- configure Git for the first time after cloning with your name and email
  ```bash
  git config --local user.name "Volodymyr Yahello"
  git config --local user.email "vyahello@gmail.com"
